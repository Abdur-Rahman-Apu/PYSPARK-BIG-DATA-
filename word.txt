Big Data refers to a massive set of data that no conventional data management tool can handle. Big Data is therefore a concept that allows access to gigantic databases in real time. Big Data's main objectives are to improve a company's or system's responsiveness to a large amount of data collected, increase productivity and refine knowledge of customer behavior, so that it can offer personalized offers or advertisements and create new trends.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that connects physical or virtual objects to the internet. The technology very often used is the sensor, allowing to link a physical object such as a watch, a drone or even a speaker, to the internet. If for a long time the few objects connected to the Internet were the telephone and the computer, this is no longer the case today and every year new types of objects incorporating IOT technology are born. IOT is one of the greatest technological revolutions of our era and its potential for exploitation is immense. IOT could have a huge impact on the cars of the future or on the new versions of smart-cities, an urban space connected to the Internet, thus significantly improving the lives of users, while reducing the negative impact of these on the planet.
